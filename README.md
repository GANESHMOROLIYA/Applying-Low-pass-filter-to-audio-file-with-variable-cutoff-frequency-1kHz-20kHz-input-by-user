# Applying-Low-pass-filter-to-audio-file-with-variable-cutoff-frequency-1kHz-20kHz-input-by-user
 In this project, we focus on implementing a low-pass filter to attenuate frequencies
 above a user-defined cutoff frequency.A low-pass filter is a filter that passes signals
 with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with
 frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. The exact frequency response of the
 filter depends on the filter design. The filter is sometimes called a high-cut filter, or
 treble-cut filter in audio applications. A low-pass filter is the complement of a
 high-pass filter.
 In optics, high-pass and low-pass may have different meanings, depending on whether
 referring to the frequency or wavelength of light, since these variables are inversely
 related. High-pass frequency filters would act as low-pass wavelength filters, and vice
 versa. For this reason, it is a good practice to refer to wavelength filters as short-pass
 and long-pass to avoid confusion, which would correspond to high-pass and low-pass
 frequencies.
 Low-pass filters exist in many different forms, including electronic circuits such as a
 hiss filter used in audio, anti-aliasing filters for conditioning signals before
 analog-to-digital conversion, digital filters for smoothing sets of data, acoustic
 barriers, blurring of images, and so on. The moving average operation used in fields
 such as finance is a particular kind of low-pass filter and can be analyzed with the
 same signal processing techniques as are used for other low-pass filters. Low-pass
 filters provide a smoother form of a signal, removing the short-term fluctuations and
 leaving the longer-term trend.
 Filter designers will often use the low-pass form as a prototype filter. That is a filter
 with unity bandwidth and impedance. The desired filter is obtained from the prototype
 by scaling for the desired bandwidth and impedance and transforming into the desired
 bandform (that is, low-pass, high-pass, band-pass or band-stop)
